  "title": "Divide an Array Into Subarrays With Minimum Cost II",
  "description": "## Problem Statement\n\nYou are given a 0-indexed array of integers `nums` of length `n`, and two positive integers `k` and `dist`.\n\nThe cost of an array is the value of its first element. For example, the cost of `[1,2,3]` is 1 while the cost of `[3,4,1]` is 3.\n\nYou need to divide `nums` into `k` disjoint contiguous subarrays, such that the difference between the starting index of the second subarray and the starting index of the kth subarray should be less than or equal to `dist`. In other words, if you divide `nums` into the subarrays `nums[0..(i1 - 1)]`, `nums[i1..(i2 - 1)]`, ..., `nums[ik-1..(n - 1)]`, then `ik-1 - i1 <= dist`.\n\nReturn the minimum possible sum of the cost of these subarrays.\n\n## Example 1\n\n**Input:**\n```\nnums = [1,3,2,6,4,2], k = 3, dist = 3\n```\n\n**Output:**\n```\n5\n```\n\n**Explanation:** The best possible way to divide nums into 3 subarrays is: [1,3], [2,6,4], and [2]. This choice is valid because ik-1 - i1 is 5 - 2 = 3 which is equal to dist. The total cost is nums[0] + nums[2] + nums[5] which is 1 + 2 + 2 = 5.\nIt can be shown that there is no possible way to divide nums into 3 subarrays at a cost lower than 5.\n\n## Example 2\n\n**Input:**\n```\nnums = [10,1,2,2,2,1], k = 4, dist = 3\n```\n\n**Output:**\n```\n15\n```\n\n**Explanation:** The best possible way to divide nums into 4 subarrays is: [10], [1], [2], and [2,2,1]. This choice is valid because ik-1 - i1 is 3 - 1 = 2 which is less than dist. The total cost is nums[0] + nums[1] + nums[2] + nums[3] which is 10 + 1 + 2 + 2 = 15.\nThe division [10], [1], [2,2,2], and [1] is not valid, because the difference between ik-1 and i1 is 5 - 1 = 4, which is greater than dist.\nIt can be shown that there is no possible way to divide nums into 4 subarrays at a cost lower than 15.\n\n## Example 3\n\n**Input:**\n```\nnums = [10,8,18,9], k = 3, dist = 1\n```\n\n**Output:**\n```\n36\n```\n\n**Explanation:** The best possible way to divide nums into 3 subarrays is: [10], [8], and [18,9]. This choice is valid because ik-1 - i1 is 2 - 1 = 1 which is equal to dist.The total cost is nums[0] + nums[1] + nums[2] which is 10 + 8 + 18 = 36.\nThe division [10], [8,18], and [9] is not valid, because the difference between ik-1 and i1 is 3 - 1 = 2, which is greater than dist.\nIt can be shown that there is no possible way to divide nums into 3 subarrays at a cost lower than 36.\n\n## Constraints\n\n- `1 <= n <= 10^5`\n- `1 <= nums[i] <= 10^9`\n- `1 <= k <= n`\n- `1 <= dist <= n`",
